# Auth0 NodeJS Seed
This example integrates [Auth0](https://auth0.com) into a Node.js web app.

It implements Auth0's [regular Node app](https://github.com/auth0/node-auth0/tree/master/examples/nodejs-regular-webapp) sample project. The result is a simple web app that allows you to register, login with a username and password and logout.

It's a useful base from which you can leverage Auth0's other functionality, such as adding login options like Google, Facebook and Twitter.
